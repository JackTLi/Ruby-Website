				I designed a poster to showcase the details of the event in an 
				structured and engaging approach. Because the event was opened to only 
				SVP'Â’s partners, this poster was sent through email.

			h2 INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
			p.
				I created the poster through a specific architecture that would allow 
				our partners to make a decision by the logic of how people would check 
				their availability; date, time, and then location. It is sorted by the 
				most significant to least significant.
