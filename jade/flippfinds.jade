			h4 CHALLENGES				
			p.
				Where to put all the di erent sections (below each other, or beside articles).
				Below each other would hide the other sections since it is not located at a prominent location, which can cause users to overlook or not
				scroll past the articles to view the other sections. (Desk- top). We decided to go with this approach for mobile, since mobile screens are
				a lot smaller in width therefore we didnâ€™t not have the space to have the sections beside the article. Therefore, we ranked according to
				the most important to least.
			p.
				Beside articles allows the sections to be viewed instantly since it is on the whole screen, when the website loads. (Desktop)
