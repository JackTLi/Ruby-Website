			h2 SOLUTION
			p.
				The user will learn about different types of music, genres and popular sections of each song in each 
				different genre as they accomplish/complete the levels. As the player progresses through the 9 levels, 
				there will be quiz games with many different concepts that demonstrate Jamaican music culture. 
				Through all nine levels we intend to have the types of questions get progressively harder.

			h2 USABILITY
			p.
				The playtest was an event used to showcase our working prototypes for usability and game mechanic feedback.
				 The feedback would be produced by players that are not Global Business and Digital Arts students. 
				 This allowed the feedback to be diverse and unbiased. Some of the testers were from the Game Institute; 
				therefore we got constructive feedback from actual developers and testers.
				
		div.text-box.float-left.middle
			h2 TOOLS USED
			p.
				Since our game is a music based quiz game and the event had a lot of people we provided headphones to improve the users experience. 
				To record the feedback and data, we decided to use QuickTime player, a phone, and a laptop. QuickTime player was used to screen record; 
				this allows us to document how the users would navigate through the game. We used the laptop to write down the answers to the 
				questions that we tested the players on. During the course of the event we tested around seven testers. These testers consist of 
				two or one persons playing together or individually. 
				This allowed us to test our game and determine whether our game was more successfully played collaboratively or individually.
				
		div.text-box.float-left.middle
			h2 FEEDBACK
			p.
				We had 7 play testers with some being pairs with the majority having no trouble navigating through the interface and our menus. 
				The suggestions what were noted were: making the song clip shorter, showing the correct answer if answered incorrectly, 
				and including the instruction on the menu. Other suggestions were to include better button feedback, more animations, and educational facts.

			h2 FINAL PRODUCT
			p.
				After reading through the feedback and analyzing which areas would increase  usability and interest of the players 
				there were many areas of the game that we  needed to change. Some aspects include colour scheme, the amount of 
				graphics,  the way certain features are presented, and the content of the game. Because  we decided on large UI 
				improvements we had to take out extra time to redesign  our game and re-implement the look of it. At the same time, 
				since our major  features were implemented all we had to change was the look of the game.  Some areas included 
				the way certain things were placed and arranged such as  the timer and the amount of questions in each level.
