			p.
				SVP's past Impact Report had the same design and layout for many years. The manager of operations voiced her 
				concern about needing a new design that would attract more interest and have better readability. The impact 
				report is a document that highlights SVP’s contributions to the community that year, and is used as a 
				promotional tool for attracting future investors.

			p.
				I started by going over the previous reports, searching for areas that could be improved. From this, I decided on a number of enhancements such as creating a table of contents for the reader, and color coding sections with SVP’s colors to separate the individual modules. I also included large amounts of relevant images to create a greater emotional connection with the reader.
