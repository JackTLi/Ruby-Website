way. The event was exclusive to SVP partners, and two versions of the design were created. 
</p></div></section><section id="familybbq-simplifiedversion" class="content-width portfolio-text overlapping-box"><span class="ipad-image"></span><div class="text-box with-bg float-right"><h2>SIMPLIFIED VERSION</h2><p>The simplified version consists of a generic poster that included the event name and date, 
this was posted onto SVPâ€™s social media accounts and website as a teaser to their partners. 
The goal of this teaser was so no fy SVP partners and allow them 
to save the date while the other details of the event are being finalized.
</p></div><div class="text-box float-right"><h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2><p>When laying out the information architecture, the goal was to be as brief and clear as possible. 
To do this, I focused on presenting just the title and date.
</p></div><div style="clear: both;line-height:0;">&nbsp;</div></section><section id="familybbq-complexversion" class="content-width portfolio-text"><div class="text-box with-bg float-left"> <h2>DETAILED VERSION</h2><p>The detailed version consists of the same poster with greater detail. 
To ensure only partners will be coming, we sent the invitation through email.
</p></div><div class="text-box float-left"><h2>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2><p>I created the poster through a specific architecture that would allow our partners to make a 
decision by the logic of how people would check their availability; date, time, and then location. 
It is sorted by the most significant to least significant.
