This was disorganized and what was included in the package was not clearly defined. 
New partners could lose vital pieces of information since the sheets could easily fall out.

I proposed to create a single 
cohesive document that included all the original sections. 
This document is designed to be easily navigated by new partners. Some usability features that I focused on were:
</p></div><div class="text-box float-left"><h2>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p>This acts as a navigation for the document and gives a high level view of the document at a glance.
</p></div><div class="text-box float-left"><h2>FAQ PAGE</h2><p>Enhanced visibility by increasing the font-weight of contact email and social media usernames 
for partners to seek out important information.
</p></div><div class="text-box float-left"><h2>OVERALL THEME</h2><p>Colour coded each section, and maintained a constant theme. This gives a visual indication to know when a 
section has started and ended. This allows partners to easily identify the different topics.
