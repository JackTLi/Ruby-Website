</label><div class="content"><p>A bike represents user experience at its best. For any product/service to have meaning, it needs to fulfill a 
specific “need” from the user. For a bike, that need is traveling. Before adding any features (complexity) to 
products and services, it’s important to identify the core reason as to why the user needs it and what problem is 
being solved. When core reasons are not identified properly, it can lead to unnecessary complications and confusion 
for the user. </p><p>If we dive deeper into the design of the bike, we can see that everything is there to serve an important and 
unique purpose. If we were to take away any component on the bike, it would not be able to fulfill the user’s 
need to travel. Removing the handlebars removes the user’s ability to make the bicycle’s ability to steer. 
Removing a pedal would mean that the user will be unable to pedal the bike. Removing just a single link from 
its chain will completely ruin the bike’s ability to move.
